### Complementary filter

The complementary filter estimates orientation based on accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope measurements collected from the user device.

The example directory contains code that simulates IMU measuremetns of pendulum and estimates pendulum orientation with the complementary filter. It is possible to plot the result of orientation estimation with python script located at helpers directory.
